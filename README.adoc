= Building Walkthroughs from arbitrary AsciiDoc directory

Walkthroughs render in Solution Explorer, but arbitrary adoc files do not.

This script creates a ~/tutorial-web-app-walkthroughs directory and populates it with a set of walkthroughs derived from the <target directory>


To view a directory of adoc files in Solution Explorer:

. Clone https://github.com/integr8ly/tutorial-web-app into your home directory:
+
----
cd 
git clone https://github.com/integr8ly/tutorial-web-app

---- 

. Run the script to create and populate ~/tutorial-web-app-walkthroughs:
+
----
xfc <target directory>
---- 
+
where <target directory> is the directory that contains the raw AsciiDoc files.

. Run Solution Explorer:
+
----
cd tutorial-web-app
yarn install
yarn start:dev

----
